As the title implies this is my very first blog post , ever.I struggled on getting somthing to talk about ,so I thought I would introduce myself.

My name is Michael Nyamande ,I'm a 20 year old techie living in Chiredzi ,Zimbabwe.

I love **programming** , so far I've learned .

C 

Visual Basic 

Java

    (Android Programming)

Python

    Basics

    Using external modules(BeatifulSoup,Fuzzywuzzy ,etc)
    
    Django(Build a simple blogging app)

Web Development

     <HTML/>

     CSS
       {FOUNDATION
       SASS}
     
     JAVASCRIPT

     JEKYLL(created this site)


and I'm not going to stop there ,I always try to empower myself by learning new things.I'm constantly browsing the web looking for new technologies-
as a consequence I easily get distracted and don't get much done ,but I try. I create this blog as a way to try and document my work ,I'll be posting weekly updates 
of my escapadess in tech ,aswell as some tutorials whenever I learn something cool ,I think I should share.
